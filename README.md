# Flexibase

The Flexibase repo - not for implementations of flexibase, but for
specifications, software patterns and design.

Flexibase is a language-agnostic specification for a service-based application
framework and creation process. There is a specification for the core concepts,
a specification for optional but recommended services, and soon various
diagrams, examples, etc.

The specification is currently in a draft state and (constructive) comments are
welcome.

See:

* [Flexibase Specification (RFC)](flexibase-spec-rfc.md) - Current state of the
  Flexibase core specification.
* [Flexibase core services](flexibase-core-services.md) - Recommended services
  to include with implementations.
